<p><strong>The ABAIT Program is a software tool that may be used in any residential or in-patient setting caring for individuals with dementia. </strong></p>
<p>ABAIT began development in 2010 with the goal developing a tool that would meet the following needs of caregivers:

	<ul>
		<li>
	Provide education and knowledge regarding what works and what does not work within the field at the point of giving care and in a logical and user–friendly format designed for all education levels.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provide a platform for capturing individualized information about why behaviors happen. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			Provide strategies to prevent or effectively interve in these behaviors. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			Provide a common language for reporting and communication.
		</li>
		<li> 
			Allow access to pertinent information, in real time, at the point of service.
		</li>

	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The ABAIT platform is a multi-component clinical decision support tool that specifically is designed to facilitate:
	<ul>
		<li>
		Longitudinal tracking of triggers of the person experiencing cognitive changes to provide historical perspective of un-communicated needs that lead to behavioral episodes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Real time access to historically validated, individualized behavior prevention and intervention strategies.
		</li>
		<li>
			Efficient mechanism for capturing behavior episodes in as they occur.
		</li>
		<li>
			Global analysis of individual resident behavior patterns/portfolios for improved behaviors outcome management.
		</li>
		<li>
			Resource analysis of staff/caregiver utilization and practice patterns centered around behavioral management.
		</li>
		<li>
			On demand educational training modules to support care providers in behavior management and ABAIT platform.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	How is ABAIT Accessed?
</p>
<p>
	The ABAIT Platform may be subscrbed as a cloud service, or installed on local servers. The product is designed for use by all caregivers regardless of setting and the simplicity of the program allows all levels of training and expertise to utilize its functionality. The product is safeguarded by the standards outlined in HIPAA guidelines.
</p>

<em>Goals</em>
<p><ol><li> This tool can be used as an aid in understanding a person with dementia’s needs through identification of triggers (antecedents), behaviors (responses), and unique interventions that can help to keep this individual safe, comfortable, and free from fear therefore preventing the escalation to difficult behaviors.</li>
<li> This tool can be used as a staff training aide to facilitate understanding of the individualized needs, fears and behaviors of each person with dementia therefore promoting the development of a person-centered prevention plan that allows staff to have successful daily interactions. </li>
<li>This tool provides a structure to analyze data on times, types, frequency, severity, and responses to symptoms of dementia including difficult behaviors. This analysis can facilitate the physician's medication management of a person including the prescription, titration, and reduction of medications to help keep the individual in the least restrictive physical and chemical environment. </li>
<li>This tool can be used to collect a factual representation for documentation purposes of behavior demographics like date, time, behavior, severity, and interventions to meet regulatory requirements of difficult behaviors and use of PRN psychotropics. </li></ol></p> 
<em>Objectives</em>
<p>
<ol>
<li>A decrease in symptoms of dementia due to an understanding of how to set up a safe, comfortable and fear-free environment for people with dementia.</li> 
<li>A decrease in staff turnover due to an increase in staff support, success, and positive interactions with people with dementia.</li>
<li>A decrease in symptoms of dementia and therefore a decrease in use of PRN and regularly scheduled psychotropics with people with dementia.</li>
<li>An increase in regulatory survey success due to a user friendly system of data collection that is set up to meet regulatory guidelines. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><strong>Can the Industrial Design of Long Term Care Absorb the Accelerating Burden from Dementia Residents?</strong></p>
<em>Trends</em>
<p><ol>
<li>Growth in Absolute Numbers</li>
<li>Acceleration of Dementia </li>
<li>Dementia Residents Demand More Staff Time</li>
<li>Dementia Increases Number of PRNs</li>
<li>Dementia Increases Number of Regulatory Citations</li>
<li>Fear by Staff to Treat Dementia Patients</li>
<li>Dementia has a Negative Impact on Staff Turnover</li>
</ol></p>
<em>Economics of Dementia on Long Term Care Facilities</em>
<p><ol>
<li>Staff Time Increases Per Resident</li>
<li>Number of PRNs Increases</li>
<li>Complexity of Regulatory Compliance Increases Number of Citations</li>
<li>Staff Turnover Increases</li>
</ol></p>
<em>Needs</em>
<p><ol>
<li>Improve Resident Care</li>
<li>Digital Movement System that Catalogs Patient and Staff Activity Among Dementia Residents</li>
<li>Digital Reference Tool that can Remind Staff of Idiosyncrasies of Patient Triggers and Intervention Methods</li>
<li>More Reliable Patient Care</li>
<li>System that can Quickly Answer Regulatory Audits</li>
<li>Reduce Regulatory Citations</li>
<li>Improve Staff Success to Reduce Staff Turnover</li>
</ol>
